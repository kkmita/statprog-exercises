# statprog-exercises

A set of open datasets and tasks to practice skills required for the statistical programmer in clinical trials job.

It has been created due to the absence of available programming challenges
tailored to the role of statistical programmer.

Currently, two tasks are available in form of `.sas` files:

* `group_report.sas` uses curated artificial data from R `mmrm` package,
and is based on data summarization and presentation in a form of html report,
* `windows.sas` uses rules for creating analysis flag in case of multiple
observations recorded within each time window according to the 
Statistical Analysis Plan for a real clinical study obtained
from clinicaltrials.gov.
